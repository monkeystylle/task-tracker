### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Feature-Based Architecture**:
   - The codebase is organized by features (e.g., `tickets`, `auth`, `comments`) rather than by type (e.g., `components`, `hooks`, `utils`).
   - Each feature contains its own components, hooks, and utilities, making it easier to scale and maintain the application.
